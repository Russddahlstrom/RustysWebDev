            <h2>The Fast and the Furious</h2>
            <p>I remember the first time I watched this movie and could not get over how much fun the characters had while driving their cars. I felt like I wanted to be a part of them, fit in, have my own car! I became obsessed with owning my own <em>cool</em>                car. I had been bitten with a bug filled with nitrus oxide and couldn't get enough.</p>

            <h2>1998 Subaru Legacy Outback</h2>
            <p>Rugged and ready for off-road adventures. As a new Freshman in highschool, having just got my drivers license, I was old enough to go out and find my first car. The hunt became something that to this day is a favorite hobby. I looked on FB
                Marketplace in class, KSL Classifides during lunch, and drove aroung to all the used car dealerships. Everyone who passes through Idaho knows how much snow can come in the wintertime so I made it priotrity that this first car was AWD.
                I found this car and although it wasn't exactly what I dreamed of, the idea of starting on something cheap and easy to wrench on persuaded me to make it mine..</p>

            <img src="assets/img/wrxwagon.jpg" alt="Subaru WRX">
            <h2>Subaru WRX</h2>
            <p>Turbocharged fun with rally-inspired performance. The WRX is built for handling twisty roads and spirited driving. This specific car was my first racecar. I loved it for its AWD and the noises it would make. Not just the creaking and cracking
                from the old interior pieces, but from the straight-piped exhaust and blow off valve. What a smile I always had on my face when driving this beauty.

            <img src="assets/img/redjetta.jpg" alt="'12 VW Jetta TDI">
            <h2>VW Jetta</h2>
            <p>My diesel VW sure doesnt look like a race car but people get why I love it so much when I tell them it comes with 260 ft-pounds of torque and in the same car getting 45 mpg. A true legend of a daily driver. My plans with this car are simple,
                keep it low, slow, and safe to continue driving and enjoying with my future family.</p>

            <img src="assets/img/chaser.jpg" alt="Toyota Chaser">
            <h2>Toyota Chaser</h2>
            <p>A car built and sold only outside the United States, this 90's family car/sedan packs a special punch. It's powered by a turbocharched 2.8 liter 6 cylinder engine that pushes out roughly 270 bhp. Now that might not seem like much but with
                simple bolt-on modifications this little family car will push upwards of 600 bhp. A right hand drive, RWD drifting machine, created to truly enjoy as a daily driver and racecar. It's been on my wishlist since I was a kid and I'm working
                towards owning my very own.</p>
